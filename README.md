# Repository Rating
Repository Rating is a small mobile app created using React Native for the frontend and GraphQL and SQLite for the backend. 

The frontend was made from scratch, utilizing Apollo-Client for communicating with the server. It features a few premade components from UI libraries such as React Native Paper, while the rest are handmade custom components. 

The backend was made and provided by Kalle Ilves from University of Helsinki. It utilizes Apollo-Server for creating the GraphQL server and uses SQLite for storing data.

Due to the registration fee, unfortunately I was not able to publish the app to Google Play.

# Usage
The application provides users the ability to create an account, log in or out of it, and rate and review repositories. 

The homepage features all available repositories to rate. Each repository can be viewed, and each view contains a link to the repository on GitHub, as well as all the reviews it has. 

The user also has an option to view their created reviews.
